The Purpose of the AEMMAWiki

This wiki was envisioned to function as AEMMA's online database of manuscripts, scholarship, and training resources. This project will democratize AEMMA's resources to meet the needs of our growing community of AEMMA Chapters and students. This way, no AEMMA chapter will have an over or under abundance of research and training material.

The secondary aim of this project is to provide a shared space for the collection (and generation) of AEMMA scholarship. AEMMA overflows with the talent, intellect, ingenuity, and passion of its members; it deserves to be passed on to AEMMA's students one hundred years from now.
